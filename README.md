## Big O Notaion

Relationships between inputs to a function and its runtime, rep `O(f(n))` and is worst case scenario. `f(n)`could be linear`n`, quadratic `n^2`, constant `1` etc.

### Time Complexity

#### Big O Rules

1. Reduce constants to `1`.
2. Exclude smaller terms in the expression.
3. Arithmetic ops are constant.
4. Accessing elements in `array` or `object` by `index` or `key` is constant.
5. Complexity of a loop is its length times whatever's happening inside it.
